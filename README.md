# Network Security Analysis with Wireshark 🌐  
[![Academic Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/MSc%20Project-Wireshark%20Labs-blue)](https://github.com/Mohammad-mo-02)

This project demonstrates network traffic analysis using **Wireshark** as part of the MSc Cybersecurity module *COS7055-B: Network & Security*. A `.pcapng` file was analysed for FTP communication, TCP session management, and protocol behaviour — identifying insecure credentials and network vulnerabilities.

 📁 Included Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Wireshark-Network-Analysis-Report.pdf` | Coursework-based analysis covering TCP sessions, FTP credentials, and session teardown. |
| `assignment.pcapng` | Raw packet capture analysed using Wireshark (contains FTP traffic and session flags). |

 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

- 🧪 **Wireshark** – Packet filtering, protocol analysis  
- 🌐 **TCP/IP Stack** – Session handshake, teardown, port allocation  
- 🔍 **FTP Traffic Analysis** – Username/password in plaintext  
- 🔐 **Vulnerability Highlighting** – Insecure protocols (FTP), spoofing risk, plaintext credentials

---

 📚 Learning Outcomes

- ✅ Identified common internet protocols (TCP, UDP, DNS, ARP)  
- ✅ Analysed raw packet data for login credentials  
- ✅ Described TCP 3-way and 4-way handshake with technical accuracy  
- ✅ Understood port behaviour (ephemeral ports, port 21 FTP)  
- ✅ Demonstrated secure communication vs insecure protocols

 🏷️ Academic Context

> This analysis was part of a summative assessment for the module **COS7055-B: Network and Security** as part of my MSc Cybersecurity degree at the University of Bradford.
